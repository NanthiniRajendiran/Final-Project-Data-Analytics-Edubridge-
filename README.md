# Machine Learning 
# Diabetes Detection Final Project

## Tools :
   * Python3, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tableau & Scikit-learn

## Context :
   * Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level (hyperglycemia) over a prolonged period of time. Symptoms often include frequent urination, increased thirst and increased appetite.If left untreated, diabetes can cause many health complications.Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment.
     
   * At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced to predict Diabetes.
   
 ## Problem Statement :     
   * Build a model to predict Whether a person is prone to Diabetes are not.
   
 ## Description :
   * There are 9  Variables that describes the features of the Dataset.
